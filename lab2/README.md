- [x] (2p) Create a Web application containing the following components:
- [x] input.jsp: a page containing a form for introducing a record, i.e. a triple containing a category, a key and a value. (The key may be a word and the value may be its definition). The categories are not static, being read from a server-side component (an object);
- [x] result.jsp a page describing the response that will be delivered to the client, for example an HTML table containing the records stored on the server.
- [x] an object-oriented domain model;
- [x] a server-side component responsible with the business-logic of the application: writing the record to a server-side data structure, reading data from it, etc.
- [x] a server-side component responsible with controlling the web-flow.
- [x] (1p) Create the following web filters:
- [x] A web filter that will log all requests received by input.jsp.
- [x] A web filter that will decorate the response by adding a specific prelude (at the beginning) and a specific coda (at the end) to the generated HTML page. 
- [ ] (0.5p) Create a web listener that reads a default category specified as a context init parameter at the application start-up. This default value should be stored in an attribute having application scope and it will be used whenever the request does not contain a category.
- [ ] (0.5p) Use a "hand-made" cookie to store the category selected by the client. When the user returns to the site (after the current session was invalidated) and presents this cookie, the category will be set automatically. 
- [ ] (1p) Add an original, math-inspired, CAPTCHA facility to the input form.
